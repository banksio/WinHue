### 1.1 Light states
The sliders in WinHue are used to control most properties of the lights in the system. They are located on the right hand side of the window, in the colored pane.

The lights selected will update when you release your mouse cursor from the slider.

You can also click the slider, then use the arrow keys on your keyboard to adjust the properties in more detail.
#### 1.1.1 Switch a light on or off
Double click the light. The light will toggle. (If it is on, it will switch off. If it is off, it will switch on.)
#### 1.1.2 Change a light's brightness
Click on the light, and adjust the brightness slider on the right of the window. The brightness of the light will update when you release the slider.
#### 1.1.3 Change a light's color temperature
Click on the light, and adjust the color temperature slider on the right of the window.
#### 1.1.4 Change a light's color
###### Color
Click on the light, and adjust the color slider on the right of the window.
###### Saturation
Adjust the saturation slider on the right of the window.
###### XY Values
Adjust the X and Y sliders on the right of the window.
#### 1.1.5 Adjust the transition time
The transition time defines how long a light will take to fade to its new state.

You can adjust this with the slider at the bottom of the pane on the right.
